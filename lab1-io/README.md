This is a two-pass linker written in Python by Jumana Ibrahim. It uses the Python `readline()` method to read input from the terminal. After running the program using `python3 twoPassLinker_jumana.py` you can paste your values in the terminal and type `Ctrl-D` to display the output. Or you can use redirection and type: `python3 twoPassLinker_jumana.py < input_file` to display the output.
